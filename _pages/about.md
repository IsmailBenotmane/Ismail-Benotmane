"I’m a Master’s student at HEC Paris, where my interests lie in finance and economics, and a Mathematics undergraduate at Sorbonne University. In financial markets, I’m drawn to the challenge of researching companies, analysing market drivers, integrating alternative data, and forming earnings forecasts, a probabilistic puzzle assembled from scattered clues in a stochastic environment.

In AI, I’m particularly interested in mechanistic interpretability for the possibility of opening up black-box models, enabling performance breakthroughs while ensuring AI safety. I’m also fascinated by reinforcement learning, especially in video game environments, where improving an agent to the point of being outplayed by it demands careful tuning of policies, rewards, and training iterations."
